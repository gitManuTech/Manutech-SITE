# About the ManuTech project

ManuTech is a site to post complains found at the Unimar university.
Simple and straight to the point.

# Introduction

The project was made for a assignment at the group's current university, Unimar.
The assignment purpose was quite simple: to make something that could 
help the university.
And _ManuTech_ is here to do just that!

## About ManuTech

This project is quite simple: let there be a problem-- an lightbulb explodes
in some hall where students pass through with frequency, its shards falls into
the ground waiting for someone step and cut his feet. But you can't warn
everyone, so what do you do? With ManuTech, you could warn not just the
students, but also the faculty itself that something bad had happened!
